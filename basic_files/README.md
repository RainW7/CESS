Some basic files used in the emulator, including the morphological catalog of GEMS, the throughput files of CSST, and the sky background spectrum. 
Note that the `bkg_and_tp.hdf5' is the old version of throughput and bkg spectrum, while the bkg_spec.fits and GU/GV/GI.Throughput.1st.fits are the new versions.
